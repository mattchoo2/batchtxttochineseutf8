# **Batch Convert Chinese Text Files to UTF-8 with Simplified Chinese**  

## **Introduction**  
If you have a collection of Chinese text files in different encodings (e.g., **GB2312, Big5, Traditional Chinese**), converting them all to **UTF-8 with Simplified Chinese** can be a tedious task. This guide provides a **Python-based solution** to automate the conversion for an entire folder.  

---

## **Why Convert to UTF-8?**  
- Ensures compatibility across all platforms.  
- Prevents encoding-related errors in text editors and applications.  
- UTF-8 is the global standard for modern text processing.  

---

## **The Problem with Mixed Encodings**  
Many Chinese text files may use older encodings like **GB2312, Big5, or other ANSI-based formats**, which can cause:  
‚ùå **Unreadable characters (mojibake)** when opened in the wrong encoding.  
‚ùå **Incompatibility** with modern applications that expect UTF-8.  
‚ùå **Mixing of Traditional and Simplified Chinese**, making processing inconsistent.  

To solve this, we need a script that:  
‚úÖ **Detects file encoding** automatically.  
‚úÖ **Converts Traditional Chinese to Simplified Chinese**.  
‚úÖ **Saves all files in UTF-8 format**.

## **Python Script to Automate the Conversion**  

### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Install Required Libraries**  
Run the following command to install dependencies:  
```bash
pip install chardet opencc
```
- **`chardet`** ‚Üí Detects file encoding.  
- **`opencc`** ‚Üí Converts Traditional Chinese to Simplified Chinese.  

---

### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Python Script**  
Save the following script as `convert_utf8.py`:  
```python
import os
import sys
import chardet
from opencc import OpenCC

# Get the folder where the script is located
folder_path = os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(sys.argv[0]))

# Initialize converter (Traditional to Simplified Chinese)
cc = OpenCC('t2s')

def detect_encoding(file_path):
    """Detect file encoding."""
    with open(file_path, 'rb') as f:
        raw_data = f.read()
    result = chardet.detect(raw_data)
    return result['encoding']

def is_simplified_chinese(text):
    """Check if text is already in Simplified Chinese."""
    converted = cc.convert(text)  # Convert Traditional -> Simplified
    return text == converted  # If no changes, it's already Simplified

def convert_file(file_path):
    """Convert file to UTF-8 with Simplified Chinese."""
    encoding = detect_encoding(file_path)
    
    if encoding is None:
        print(f"Skipping {file_path}, unable to detect encoding.")
        return
    
    with open(file_path, 'r', encoding=encoding, errors='ignore') as f:
        content = f.read()

    # Check if file is already in Simplified Chinese and UTF-8
    if encoding.lower() == "utf-8" and is_simplified_chinese(content):
        print(f"Skipping {file_path}, already UTF-8 and Simplified Chinese.")
        return

    # Convert to Simplified Chinese
    simplified_content = cc.convert(content)

    # Save as UTF-8
    with open(file_path, 'w', encoding='utf-8') as f:
        f.write(simplified_content)
    
    print(f"Converted {file_path} from {encoding} to UTF-8 with Simplified Chinese.")

def rename_file_if_needed(file_path):
    """Rename file if the name contains Traditional Chinese characters."""
    folder, filename = os.path.split(file_path)
    simplified_filename = cc.convert(filename)  # Convert filename
    new_path = os.path.join(folder, simplified_filename)

    if filename != simplified_filename:  # Rename only if changed
        if os.path.exists(new_path):  # Check if new filename already exists
            print(f"Skipping rename: {new_path} already exists.")
            return file_path  # Skip renaming, continue with original file

        try:
            os.rename(file_path, new_path)
            print(f"Renamed: {filename} ‚Üí {simplified_filename}")
            return new_path  # Return new file path
        except FileExistsError:
            print(f"Error: File {new_path} already exists. Skipping rename.")
            return file_path  # Skip renaming and continue
    return file_path  # Return original if not renamed

# Process all text files in the folder and subfolders
for root, _, files in os.walk(folder_path):
    for filename in files:
        if filename.startswith("~$") or not filename.endswith(".txt"):
            continue  # Skip temporary files and non-txt files
        
        file_path = os.path.join(root, filename)
        file_path = rename_file_if_needed(file_path)  # Rename if necessary
        convert_file(file_path)  # Convert file

print("\n‚úÖ All necessary files (including subfolders) converted!")
input("\nPress Enter to exit...")  # Keeps the window open


```

Here‚Äôs the **fully updated script** with the following fixes and improvements:

‚úÖ **Skips files that start with `~$`** (temporary files).  
‚úÖ **Renames filenames from Traditional Chinese to Simplified Chinese**, but **skips renaming if the file already exists**.  
‚úÖ **Catches errors (like `FileExistsError`) and continues processing instead of stopping**.  
‚úÖ **Automatically detects and scans the folder it‚Äôs in**, including **all subfolders**.  
‚úÖ **Converts non-UTF-8 files to UTF-8 and Traditional Chinese content to Simplified Chinese**.
‚úÖ **Can put in any folder and run**.
---

## **3Ô∏è‚É£ Running the Script**
1. Place the script in the same folder as your text files or adjust `folder_path` to the correct location.  
2. Run the script using Python:  
   ```bash
   python convert_utf8.py
   ```
3. The script will scan all `.txt` files in the folder, detect their encoding, convert them to **UTF-8 + Simplified Chinese**, and overwrite the original files.  

---

## **Common Errors and Fixes**  

### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Unicode Escape Error (`\U` Issue)**  
**Error Message:**  
```
SyntaxError: (unicode error) 'unicodeescape' codec can't decode bytes in position 2-3
```
**Fix:** Use either of the following solutions:  
‚úî Use a **raw string** by adding `r` before the path:  
```python
folder_path = r"path/to/your/folder"
```
‚úî Use **double backslashes (`\\`)**:  
```python
folder_path = "C:\\path\\to\\your\\folder"
```

## **Conclusion**  
This script provides an efficient way to **batch convert** all Chinese text files in a folder to **UTF-8 with Simplified Chinese**, solving encoding issues and ensuring consistency.  

‚úÖ **Automatic encoding detection**  
‚úÖ **Traditional to Simplified conversion**  
‚úÖ **Batch processing for an entire folder**  

Now, you can safely manage and use your text files without worrying about encoding errors! üöÄ
